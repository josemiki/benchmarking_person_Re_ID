# Benchmarking person re-identification datasets and approaches for practical real-world implementations
Here we are going to publish complete results for our paper.
## Complete results for cross-dataset experiments
This section presents all the results from our cross-dataset Re-ID experiments. Four standard Re-ID approaches are trained on three different standard Re-ID datasets, and evaluated on a different dataset. The complete results from these experiments are reported in Table~\ref{tab:cross_full_res}, Table~\ref{tab:cross_full_res_pair} and Table~\ref{tab:cross_scal_full_res} .
